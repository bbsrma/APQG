<ul>
  <li>The student evaluation system is one of the fundament and critical processes of maintaining and assuring quality in education delivery under a university. A good quality curriculum is essential for implementation of a good student evaluation system.</li><br/>
  
  <li> One of the features of a fair student evaluation system is the absence of “unexpected/ unusual/ unreasonable/ unbalanced” questions. Each student has the right to know what he/she will be tested on, and what the scope of the questions is. The subject matter of the questions cannot go beyond the scope of the Expected Learning Outcome (ELO), and concerned student /teacher /question-setter/answer-book-evaluator should be made aware of the ELOs of each subject.</li><br/>
  <li>The different person's who are involved in question paper generation should maintain the secrecy of paper.  </li><br/>
  <li>Marks of each questions in "Q.No. a" must be "7" and that of "Q.No. b" must be 8.</li><br/>
  <li>Complexity of each questions must be assigned .</li><br/>
  <li>Figures should be given clearly. </li><br/>
  <li> Question setter/moderator should not be close to perspective examinee. It means secrecy of questions paper should be maintain. </li><br/>
  <li> The question setters (teachers) should be trained/oriented for the task assigned to them. The Terms of Reference needs to be revised by adding specific instruction/guidelines on limiting questions to the specific scope of ELOs of each subject, and to avoid “surprise, unexpected, unusual, requiring specific assumptions, found only in a certain specific hard to obtain out of print books” type of questions. Similarly, each question should be “solvable” without rushing, within given amount of time, as indicated by marks assigned to the question.</li><br/>
  <li>Enough orientation/information should be provided  and the prepared questions have to follow the organization's system (syllabus, full mark, pass mark, chapter weightage, chapter scope, ELOs).</li><br/>
  <li>The “expected time required by the examinees to solve/answer the question” should be added in the moderators’ guideline.</li>
</ul>
